<p align="center"><b>My solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 in NodeJS</b></p>
<hr>

Each day consists of two puzzles. <br>
I added a README.md file to each Day, which contains the instructions exactly as they were displayed on https://adventofcode.com/

## :rocket: Launching all solutions with benchmark

I've created a script to launch all days in order and display the solutions along with an approximated benchmark (HR-Time)

No dependencies needed. Just launch the script by executing `npm start`.

**Note:** The benchmark currently is too inaccurate. It takes way too much overhead into account.
