<p align="center"><b>My solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 in NodeJS</b></p>
<hr>

Each day consists of two puzzles. <br>
I added a README.md file to each Day, which contains the instructions exactly as they were displayed on https://adventofcode.com/

## :rocket: Launching all solutions with benchmark

Each script can be run stand-alone / separatly but I've also created a `startAll.js` script to launch all days in order, and display the solutions along with an approximated benchmark (the benchmark uses [`performance.now()`](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html#perf_hooks_performance_now) to measure the execution time and **does not include the actual reading of the file** except when the file is read line-by-line).

No dependencies needed. Just launch the script by executing `npm start`.
